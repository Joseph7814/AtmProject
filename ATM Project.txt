In Java Project, we created an ATM program for representing ATM transection. In the ATM program, the user has to select an option
from the options displayed on the screen. To deposit the money, we simply get the deposit amount from the user, add it to the total
balance and print the successful message

The operations used in our project are : 

1. Withdraw Amount

2. Deposit Amount

3. Check Balance

4. EXIT
